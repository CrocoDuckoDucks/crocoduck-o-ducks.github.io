I am an open-source, music and science enthusiast.

All over my life I have been interested in music, finding it the form of art that I enjoy more deeply. When I was a CrocoDuckling I was used to play the scientist as well, not only the rock-star. In fact, I have always been so amused by the stars, the life… the whole universe that I wanted to be able to study it, to talk with it on a deeper level.

Together with philosophical awesomeness, the interest I have been growing is nerdy as well. I started playing with computers when I was 4, when an Amiga 500 arrived in the house. It was mostly for gaming but that made me understand that a computer can make alive the creativity we have. It could make alive a whole universe as a game, or the sound-field in a auditorium with a numerical simulation. It enhances our creativity to a lot of extent.

I started using Linux when I was 12. At first just curious, I maintained a dual boot setup with windoze until at university. Then I switched to Linux only and I suddenly realized what happiness is! My Linux box helped and still helps me in all my work and play, from music to reports writing, from games to numerical simulations.

I am also interested in electronics and I have designed and built some guitar effects. I have some project going on very slowly, as most of my time is occupied by other things.

About my studies: I have a Bachelor's degree in Physics and a Master Degree in Audio Acoustics. As for the music styles I enjoy, they all have a strong Afro-American root, like blues, jazz, soul…
